# JSHexLife
Reimplementation of my old pet project in JS

Implemented:
- hexagonal (square with a simple change of a constant) toroidal lattice
- Moore neighbourhood (Chebyshev distance = 1)
- Conway's rules
- click-editing
- pausing

Planned:
- triangular lattice
- non-Conway rule configuration
- neighbourhoods taking into account non-suare lattices
- Von Neumann neighbourhood (Manhattan distance = 1)
- rule editing (neighbourhood and lattice selection)
- rules with some randomness
- cell ages
- flat finite lattices
