# JSHexLife
Reimplementation of my old pet project in JS

Implemented:
- hexagonal, triangular and square tesselations
- flat finite or toroidal surface
- Moore neighbourhood (Chebyshev distance = 1)
- Von Neumann neighbourhood (Manhattan distance = 1)
- hexagonal star, honeycomb and tripod neighbourhoods
- neighbourhood selection
- tessellation selection
- Conway's rules
- click-editing
- pausing

Planned:
- non-Conway rule configuration
- rules with some randomness
- cell ages
- semi-transparent "paused" overlay

Considering:
- Saving/restoring rules
- Saving SVG
- Saving/restoring grid with rules
